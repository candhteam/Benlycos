                  Online live streaming is the new way to broadcast real-time
                  events and activities over the internet. With audiences
                  rapidly shifting towards online video streaming platforms from
                  television, internet is the new way to go for hosting live
                  video streaming. One of the primary requisites of an online
                  livestream- fast and stable internet connection.
                </p>
                <p class="discription-paragraph">
                  This is where many corporates and independent content creators
                  face the main challenge. Relying on one broadband connection
                  is never a wise idea when you are live streaming an important
                  event. With lags and buffers, there is always the risk of
                  losing audiences’ interests.
                </p>
                <p class="discription-paragraph">
                  Zifilink has actively assessed this issue and has helped
                  numerous corporates and event management agencies with a
                  professional live streaming solution. With Zifilink’s link
                  aggregation services, live broadcasters have been able to
                  connect with up to 8 different networks for unmatched internet
                  speed and reliability.
                </p>
                <p class="discription-paragraph">
                  Thus, when one connection suffers a failover, the other
                  available connections step in and provide the same speed of
                  internet, without a buffer. In other words, when connections
                  suffer from failovers, the livestream is absolutely unaffected
                  and neither the host nor the audiences can spot an error. This
                  is a staple of a professional livestream which numerous
                  organizations have been able to accomplish with Zifilink.

                  As far as livestream is concerned, perhaps no other industry
                  is as much reliant on it as media and journalism. With the
                  utmost need to transfer multimedia data over the internet in
                  real-time, media houses require not just high-speed internet,
                  but also a reliable connection at any point of time.
                </p>
                <p class="discription-paragraph">
                  Having to report from remote areas where network connectivity
                  is significantly on the lower spectrum, many media houses face
                  challenges in delivering real-time reports even today.
                  Furthermore, with weather conditions playing a part in
                  internet speeds, there is often no guarantee that a reliable
                  internet connection source will suffice the needs of real-time
                  reporting at all times.

                  One of the Most important industries that Zifilink caters to
                  is event management. Hosting large events with a wide range of
                  audiences is always a challenge, especially if it is outdoors.
                  Numerous event management companies that we have worked with
                  have complained about one common problem- lack of reliability
                  of a single internet connection to host a live event.
                </p>
                <p class="discription-paragraph">
                  When weather conditions are not too friendly, this problem
                  only aggravates. The need for a stable internet connection in
                  the industry is of utmost significance. This is why major
                  event management companies from various genres have sought
                  Zifilink’s internet bonding services.
                </p>
                <p class="discription-paragraph">
                  Zifilink’s internet bonding service can assemble and aggregate
                  multiple internet connections and provide an exponentially
                  high internet connection speed, while also securing a reliable
                  and stable connection 24/7. Our internet bonding device
                  automatically detects active dongles and combines their power
                  to boost internet speeds. Even in case of a failover or heavy
                  load, the device automatically and instantly switches to the
                  other dongles for service or distributes the load across the
                  available dongles.
                </p>
                <p class="discription-paragraph">
                  This has helped event management companies seamlessly host
                  large events that bear significantly high data loads. With
                  multiple connections backing up their data transmission,
                  internet connectivity has been the least of all worries for
                  event organizers.

                  Some of the major event management companies had been facing
                  issues related to internet connectivity. Having to organize
                  large events with a wide range of audiences, even these
                  experienced event organizers were finding it tough to rely on
                  a particular broadband connection for their events.

                  location was devoid of any proper broadband connection, which
                  was hampering the productivity of his students and thus,

                  different mobile carriers- BSNL, Jio, and Vodafone to get a
                  stable internet connection. But this approach failed as the
                  data speed did not help in securing the kind of reliable
                  internet connection that’s needed in providing seamless online
                  education.
