              <h2>The Company</h2>
              <div class="company-content-block">
                  <p>Benlycos was formed in 2019 in the month of July by a group of 5 engineers who had spent close to 2 decades in the technology industry in various roles spanning from technology development to business development. All the founders at Benlycos clearly were looking for an opportunity to create products that can bridge the gap between the availability of technology-based solutions and the mass adoption of them for the greater good of mankind.</p>
                  <p>The team had worked together for 3 years on their first venture named Avench systems since 2016 and built numerous products for their customers, mostly OEMs from the US and Canada region. <p>Through their observations made during travel and conversations with people from across the globe, they found that one of the key barriers to many technology adoptions in developing countries was the non-availability of reliable internet connectivity and power.</p> <p>They looked around to find Watchy technologies, a startup we had built products for in the past, was working in the connectivity solutions space and decided to collaborate with them by licensing the 5 patents they had filed across the US, Europe, and Indian regions to build products using the same.</p> <p>This led to the launch of a few MVP models of the Zifilink product by 2019 and we spent the next few years learning more about different use cases, customer expectations, and challenges to develop further and come up with the Bloom line of products.</p>

              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>The solution derives its approach from the age-old wisdom credited to ‘Tecumseh’ - “A single twig breaks, but the bundle of twigs is strong”. Drawing parallels, every wireless last mile connection is relatively unreliable due to various factors that influence the quality of data transmission. Thus by combining multiple such unreliable sources of connectivity and combining them at L3 of the OSI model, we are able to increase the speed, reliability, and security of the communication at the last mile of Internet usage.</p> <p> The very fact that multiple of these connections could be from different service providers helps in reducing the impact of service deterioration of any one service provider and in addition, provides much higher speeds in contrast to using any one service provider’s solution at any point. To achieve this functionality, we have developed bespoke hardware and software which works in unison to connect with multiple available last mile internet links and manages the data flow to be more secure, higher speed, and more available with respect to applications that are physically mobile in nature. To put all this in perspective, think of the speed of internet traffic that you are able to use at your own home or an office building that has dedicated infrastructure to provide high-speed internet, and imagine having such a facility that is portable and can work in almost any ground location that you could travel to. To a lot of professionals in the broadcast industry or news gathering industry, such functionality is an essential element of being able to deliver value to their audience, and hence  Bloom is our answer to meet the needs of such professionals.</p> <p> We validated the assumption of the effectiveness of such a solution by launching an MVP of our product under the brand name “Zifilink” which was sold to more than 200 customers over a period of 3 years. We gathered all the learnings from these deployments and built “Bloom” that caters to the target segment in a more elegant manner by integrating modems and adding software features that improved the user experience multifold to create customer delight.</p> <p> Since we could find paying customers for our initial rollout of the product, we could learn much from the field and gather firsthand experience about the real-life scenarios of product deployment and benefits that could be provided with further enhancement of the solution, this inspired us to develop more effective and elegant solutions in the days to come.</p>
